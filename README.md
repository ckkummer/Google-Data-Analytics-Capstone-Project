## Introduction

**Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Course 8/8: Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Capstone Project**

This project requires me to act as a fictional  junior analyst working on the marketing analyst team for the fictional company, Cyclistic- a bike-share company based in Chicago. Cyclistic is a program that features more than 5,800 bicycles, 600 docking stations, and offers reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes.

Cyclistic appeals to a broad range of customers by offering flexible pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Cyclistic’s director of marketing is interested in designing marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. 

## Business Task

In order to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual riders, I have been tasked with answering the following:

“How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?”

> **Objective** :The goal is to discern patterns within the historical ride-trip data of Cyclistic, shedding light on the distinct ways Cyclistic members and casual riders engage with the service. This involves the thorough cleaning, analysis, and visualization of the data to uncover meaningful insights.
